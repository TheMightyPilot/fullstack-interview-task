# Moneyhub Tech Test - Investments and Holdings

At Moneyhub we use microservices to partition and separate the concerns of the codebase. In this exercise we have given you an example `admin` service and some accompanying services to work with. In this case the admin service backs a front end admin tool allowing non-technical staff to interact with data.

A request for a new admin feature has been received

## Requirements

- As an admin, I want to be able to generate a CSV report showing the values of all user investment holdings
    - Any new routes should be added to the **admin** service
    - The csv report should be sent to the `/export` route of the **investments** service
    - The investments `/export` route expects the following:
        - content-type as `application/json`
        - JSON object containing the report as csv string, i.e, `{csv: '|User|First Name|...'}`
    - The csv should contain a row for each holding matching the following headers
    |User|First Name|Last Name|Date|Holding|Value|
    - The **Holding** property should be the name of the holding account given by the **financial-companies** service
    - The **Value** property can be calculated by `investmentTotal * investmentPercentage`
    - The new route in the admin service handling the generation of the csv report should return the csv as text with content type `text/csv`
- Ensure use of up to date packages and libraries (the service is known to use deprecated packages but there is no expectation to replace them)
- Make effective use of git

We prefer:
- Functional code
- Ramda.js (this is not a requirement but feel free to investigate)
- Unit testing

### Notes
All of you work should take place inside the `admin` microservice

For the purposes of this task we would assume there are sufficient security middleware, permissions access and PII safe protocols, you do not need to add additional security measures as part of this exercise.

You are free to use any packages that would help with this task

We're interested in how you break down the work and build your solution in a clean, reusable and testable manner rather than seeing a perfect example, try to only spend around *1-2 hours* working on it

## Deliverables
**Please make sure to update the readme with**:

- Your new routes
- How to run any additional scripts or tests you may have added
- Relating to the task please add answers to the following questions;
    1. How might you make this service more secure?
    2. How would you make this solution scale to millions of records?
    3. What else would you have liked to improve given more time?


On completion email a link to your repository to your contact at Moneyhub and ensure it is publicly accessible.

## Getting Started

Please clone this service and push it to your own github (or other) public repository

To develop against all the services each one will need to be started in each service run

```bash
npm start
or
npm run develop
```

The develop command will run nodemon allowing you to make changes without restarting

The services will try to use ports 8081, 8082 and 8083

Use Postman or any API tool of you choice to trigger your endpoints (this is how we will test your new route).

### Existing routes
We have provided a series of routes

Investments - localhost:8081
- `/investments` get all investments
- `/investments/:id` get an investment record by id
- `/investments/export` expects a csv formatted text input as the body

Financial Companies - localhost:8082
- `/companies` get all companies details
- `/companies/:id` get company by id

Admin - localhost:8083
- `/investments/:id` get an investment record by id

### New routes
I have implemented a new route within the Admin micro service:

Admin - localhost:8081
- `/exports` get a csv export of all user investment holdings

### Answers to Questions

1. To make this service more secure, I would reccomend putting access to this behind Oauth or API Keys/Tokens. Other steps to make it more secure within this service being behind authentication could be that of user roles to set who can generate these exports. Also improving error handling and logging of which users have generated a report and when.

2. For scalability of the exports service, I would place the logic of generating the csv into its own micro service which can be spun up depending on how many requests from users generating these reports there is (I'm thinking of for example using GCP Cloud Run, perhaps also with a PubSub Queue), the logic would perform the work needed without locking up the Admin backend microservice, (which may be used to handle other endpoints in the future) and when the csv has been generated, store this in a bucket for example for retrival by the user. This would probably be accessed through a frontend UI allowing the user to see historical reports and generate new ones.

3. I would have liked to do a few things having more time:
- Fix the issue with sinon seemingly having an issue with stubbing the exportLogic functions.
- Provided more error handling & logging.
- Added filtering to the endpoint e.g. filter by first/last name, by company name or by date.
- Made better use of the streaming ability of the json2csv module. However this would have probably required a database to paginate through and pipe each row through to the parser.
